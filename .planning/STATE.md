## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 35 requirements with research-informed ordering
- Roadmap: Phase 3 (Picker) depends only on Phase 1, allowing parallel work with Phase 2 (AI Pipeline)
- Roadmap: Video and PWA combined into final Phase 6 since both are finishing-layer concerns

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged Serwist + Turbopack compatibility as lowest-confidence area (Phase 6)
- PuLID face consistency across 5 diverse scenes is inherently limited by current AI (Phase 5)
- fal.ai content safety filters may block innocent prompts -- needs prompt engineering care (Phase 2)
